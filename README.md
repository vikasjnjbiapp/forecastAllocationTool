Query 1. In case, if year is new year (like 2020) then there will be actual sales available for new year or how can we get the actual for all month?
Query 2. As per the previous discussion, once actual will be loaded then till the month we must freeze the forecast value. For example, let suppose we have actual sales will be 8 month then the IMS will be freeze for 8 month and 9 month onwards user can fill the IMS for each SKUs. However there is one story, which says that after approval of CVTL only IMS value must be freeze and if rejected then it must be editable. So my doubt is, when we will freeze or after importing the actual even if CVTL has not approve the IMS forecast, then actual may editable?
Query 3. if CVTL reject the IMS forecast then it will reject all SKUs forecast or it only consider the selected SKUs?

Query 4. If the actual will be imported then it will come to dashboard. So shall I make the all SKUs static or it must be in dropdown. [It will be better if I ask you this question to show the dashboard then it might more clear. So let me know, your time so I can book your calendar to explain you.]
